abstract = {We describe a compact apparatus that automatically measures the charge averaged lifetime of atmospheric muons in plastic scintillator using low-cost, low-power electronics and that measures the stopping rate of atmospheric muons as a function of altitude to demonstrate relativistic time dilation. The apparatus is designed for the advanced undergraduate physics laboratory and is suitable for field measurements.},

abstract = {An initial measurement of the lifetime of the positive muon to a precision of 16 parts per million (ppm) has been performed with the FAST1 detector at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The result is , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. The muon lifetime determines the Fermi constant, (8 ppm).},
